be sure to install node.js
then pull our git repo
change directory to angular seed
then type "npm install" pray for no errors, fix if there are
then type "npm start" and open web browser and go to localhost:8000
and boom thats how to run site. Now alls we gotta do is make the site

if you get the no python error then run the command "npm install -g npm-gyp"
if you get the no bower install error run "npm install -g bower"
then run npm install again, and it should work

also make sure you got python installed
and set the path variable for it in windows
Also install normal git, not github or anything, straight up git
